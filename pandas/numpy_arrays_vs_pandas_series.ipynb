    "1) Structure and Dimensionality:\n",
    "NumPy Array:\n",
    "* Can be multi-dimensional, representing vectors, matrices, or higher-dimensional tensors. \n",
    "* All elements within a NumPy array must be of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas Series:\n",
    "* A one-dimensional labeled array, essentially a single column of data. \n",
    "* While it can hold various data types, it is optimized for homogeneous data within a single Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Indexing:\n",
    "NumPy Array:\n",
    "Uses implicit integer-based indexing, starting from 0. Elements are accessed by their numerical position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas Series:\n",
    "Features an explicitly defined index (labels). This index can be of various data types (integers, strings, dates, etc.) and allows for more intuitive and flexible data alignment and selection based on labels, rather than just numerical position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Data Handling and Functionality:\n",
    "NumPy Array:\n",
    "Optimized for numerical computations and mathematical operations on large, homogeneous datasets. It provides efficient array-oriented operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas Series:\n",
    "Built on top of NumPy, it provides enhanced functionalities for data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and handling of missing values. Its labeled indexing simplifies data alignment during operations between Series."
